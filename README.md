# RTApp
UI to monitor data from a test platform for rocket engines.

This project was developed during my degreeÂ´s final thesis which consisted of a comparision between the analytical, simulated and experimental procedures of rocket engine noozles. This app consits of a user interface where you can see in real time how the data is been collected. Once the test is completed you can stop the sensors reading and all the results will be written and exported to a csv file. It will also show 3 graphics with variable-time charts so you can have a quickview of the results. 

The app works with the serial comunication between python and an arduino nano to which all the sensors are conected. The arduino itself has its own code as well so it ensures the correct print to serial of the data collected from the sensors.
